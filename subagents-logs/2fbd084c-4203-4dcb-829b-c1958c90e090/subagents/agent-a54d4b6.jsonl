Your job is to stress-test this idea ruthlessly but constructively. Address:\\n\\n1. **Does This Need to Exist?**: What existing tools already solve this? (grep/ripgrep, todo-tree VSCode extension, IDE built-in TODO panels, linters like eslint-plugin-no-todo, GitHub code search). What would make a new tool worth building vs using what exists?\\n2. **Are TODOs Even Good Practice?**: Challenge the premise. Many teams argue TODOs are tech debt that never gets fixed. Should TODOs be tracked, or should they be converted to issues/tickets instead? What does research/industry practice say?\\n3. **Adoption Barriers**: What would prevent developers from adopting this? Extra tooling fatigue, maintenance burden, false positives, configuration overhead.\\n4. **Failure Modes**: What goes wrong? Stale index, wrong language detection, performance on massive repos, inconsistent TODO formats across teams, noisy output.\\n5. **Scope Creep Risks**: Where could this tool try to do too much and become bloated? Where is the line between a TODO tracker and a full project management tool?\\n6. **Market & Positioning**: If this tool were open-sourced, what would make it stand out? What's the \\\"10x better\\\" story compared to `rg TODO`?\\n\\nBe honest and constructive. For every problem you identify, suggest how it might be addressed or whether it's a dealbreaker.
